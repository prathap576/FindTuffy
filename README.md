# FindTuffy – One-Stop Internship Finder

**FindTuffy** is a centralized platform that gathers internships from multiple job portals and displays them in one clean, easy-to-use dashboard.  
It is specially designed to support **Tier-2 and Tier-3 college students** who struggle to find verified and relevant internship opportunities across different platforms.

---

## 🌟 Why FindTuffy?

Students often visit 5–10 different websites to search for internships:

- LinkedIn  
- Internshala  
- Naukri  
- Indeed  
- Glassdoor  
- Company career pages  

This wastes time, creates confusion, and still misses many opportunities.  
**FindTuffy solves this by collecting internship listings from all platforms in one place.**
